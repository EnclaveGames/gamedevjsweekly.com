        Gamedev.js Weekly is a weekly newsletter about web game development, sent every Friday. It was created by
        <a href=//end3r.com>Andrzej Mazur</a> from <a href=//enclavegames.com>Enclave Games</a> at the beginning of
        2014. The <a href=/1>first issue</a> was sent out on Friday, January 10th 2014, and the newsletter gets emailed to subscribers
        every single week since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        The list currently holds about 8000 active subscribers via Mailchimp. It is built and managed organically â€” only
        those who really want to subscribe are doing so, and inactive or spam accounts are regularly removed. Open rates
        are around 25-35% a week after publication, with 6-12% click rates.
